## Overview
This repository contains reproducible code and synthetic simulation materials accompanying the working paper *“Taxing the Invisible: Robust Fiscal Design under Informational Scarcity”* (Vallarino, 2025).  
The project develops a methodological framework combining **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** and **distributionally robust optimization** to design equitable tax systems in data-scarce environments.  

The code illustrates how structural information derived from economic networks can be used to infer latent income distributions and generate redistributive tax schedules resilient to informational uncertainty.

##  Methodological Summary
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Multivariate copula-based sampling (`Gaussian`, `Clayton`) calibrated on anonymized distributions from public and institutional registries.  
- **Structural Learning:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) implemented with PyTorch Geometric learn relational embeddings of agents based on sector, education, and region.  
- **Robust Tax Optimization:** The tax schedule is estimated via minimax optimization under distributional ambiguity (Wasserstein sets).  
- **Simulation Framework:** Two stylized economies (small/cohesive and large/fragmented) test redistributive performance under informational constraints.

##  Data Availability
The repository includes scripts to reproduce all analyses.  
Due to confidentiality agreements, the original microdata cannot be shared.  
A synthetic dataset replicating the structural properties of the empirical sample is available upon request and subject to institutional approval.
